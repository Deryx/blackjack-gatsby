# Blackjack (Gatsby Version)



## About The Project
This application is computer reproduction of the classic casino card game, **Blackjack**. As with the card game, players play against the dealer, each trying to achieve a score of 21. Each player's goal is to achieve a score of 21 or less that beats the score of the dealer. If a player or the dealer gets a score above 21, he/she goes "bust" or automatically loses. Each player has a **HIT**, **STAND**, and **ACE = 11** button. Each player presses the **HIT** button to add a new card to their hand. To stop receiving cards and end their hand, each player presses the **STAND** button. To make an ace worth **11** instead of **1**, players press the **ACE = 11** to add a one addition of 10 points to their hand score.
